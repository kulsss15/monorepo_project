Design Choices for Project Architecture and Tooling
    1. Project Architecture
        The project follows a modular monorepo architecture. The structure promotes code organization, scalability, and maintainability:
            •	Apps Directory: Contains application-specific modules, such as weather_service. Each module includes its own API, models, and configurations.
            •	Libs Directory: Houses shared utility functions, such as weather_logic, api_client, and logger. These are designed to be reusable across different apps.
            •	Database: Leveraging SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL for relational data management, ensuring data integrity and query performance.
            •	Migrations: Alembic is used for database version control to track schema changes systematically.
    2. Tooling
        Development Tools
            1.	FastAPI: Chosen for its high performance, scalability, and ease of integration with modern Python tools.
            2.	Docker and Docker Compose: Ensure consistent development and deployment environments.
            3.	Pre-commit Hooks:
                o	Black and isort for code formatting.
                o	Flake8 and Pylint for linting.
                o	Mypy for static type checking.
                o	Bandit for security analysis.
        Testing Frameworks
            •	Pytest: Unit testing and integration testing.
            •	Health Checks: Built-in endpoints to validate connectivity to the database and third-party services.
        Environment Management
            •	Python-dotenv: Simplifies loading environment variables.
            •	.env file: Centralized configuration for sensitive keys (e.g., OPENWEATHER_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL).

Ensuring Scalability, Maintainability, and Developer Productivity
    1. Scalability
        •	API Design: The use of RESTful principles with clear versioning (/api/v1) ensures future extensibility.
        •	Containerization: Docker provides horizontal scalability by enabling multiple container instances.
        •	Modular Codebase: Decoupling utilities and core app logic allows independent scaling of components.
    2. Maintainability
        •	Clean Code Practices: Pre-commit hooks enforce uniform style and code quality.
        •	Database Migrations: Alembic tracks schema changes, reducing technical debt.
        •	Centralized Logging: A unified logging framework aids in debugging and monitoring.
        •	Shared Utilities: The libs directory minimizes code duplication and simplifies updates.
    3. Developer Productivity
        •	FastAPI Development Server: Built-in interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) accelerates development and testing.
        •	Pre-configured Virtual Environment: venv ensures quick project setup.
        •	Dockerized Workflow: Developers can onboard quickly without manual dependency configuration.
        •	Comprehensive Tests: High test coverage and automated health checks catch bugs early.

Conclusion
    The project architecture and tooling have been deliberately chosen to ensure long-term success. This approach promotes clean code, efficient development workflows, and the ability to scale and maintain the application effectively. By leveraging industry best practices and modern frameworks, we ensure both developer productivity and end-user satisfaction.
